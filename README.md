JIRA Metric App
=============

This app is created for the sole purpose of consuming the JIRA API using the API link you provide and providing nice tables and charts to further analyze what you can pull from JIRA's api data.

This app uses angularJS to make the Single Page application.  It is also hosted on a node.js server.
